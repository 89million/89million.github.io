Born and raised in the Seattle area. Loves hiking in the Cascades. Occasional home brewer. Enjoys reading history and thinking about historical analogs. 

In the career realm I've spent the last few years learning new skills like programming in R and to a lesser extent Python and Javascript, data visualization, machine learning, statistics, data cleaning, SQL, MongoDB, database schema, and predictive analytics. I'm also proficient with Excel and most of the Microsoft Office suite.

I hold a B.A. in History from the University of Washington
