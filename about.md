Spent the last few years learning new skills like programming in R and to a lesser extent Python and Javascript, data visualization, machine learning, statistics, data cleaning, [*takes a breath*] SQL, database schema, and predictive analytics. 

Excel master, cool with pretty much the entire Microsoft enterprise suite. Not *too* scared of the command line

Zealous learner shifting to a career in data science, interested in the application of statistical analysis to broad sets of problems. I have experience in vendor management, investigative research, quality assurance and automated processes. My other interests include hiking, reading history, and studying monetary and economic systems.

B.A. in History from the University of Washington
